## Content

The repository consists of `theory` and `practice` folders. 
`theory` folder contains presentations about SQL queries and PostgreSQL. 
`practice` folder has backups of the databases "rental", "avia" and 7 sql-files.

## Theory folder

Presentations in the `theory` folder are about working with SQL databases in PostgreSQL
